# Materials & Methods:
<hr>
To execute the programs outlined in this guide, the following materials and methods are recommended:

Materials:

1. Computer with a C compiler installed (e.g., GCC, Clang)
2. Text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) for writing and editing C code

Methods:

1.Write each program in a text editor or IDE.
2.Save the program with a .c extension (e.g., program1.c).
3.Compile each program using the C compiler installed on your computer.
4. Run the compiled program to observe its output.
5. Debug any errors encountered during compilation or execution.

1. First Program
 ```
#include<stdio.h>

int main() {

printf("Hello World");

return 0;

}
```

2. Input (Sum of 2 numbers)
```
#include<stdio.h>
int main() {
int a, b;
printf("enter a \n");
scanf("%d", &a);
printf("enter b \n");
scanf("%d", &b);
printf("sum of a & b is : %d \n", a+b);
return 0;
}
```

6. Practice Qs 1 (Area of Square)
